Hello? Hello? Hello, Jerry. - Nana! Are you ready to come to the light? Uh, I'm not sure. Where's Pop Pop? He's not coming out to meet you anymore because honestly, Jerry, this is getting annoying. It's not my fault! My father-in-law asked me to help him gather data and... Agh! Not agaaaaaain!
[GASPING] Okay, run diagnostics.
[MACHINE WHIRRING] Holy sh*t, this is consistent. This is real. - What have you done? You've got my grandparents pissed at me. They'll forgive you because... they're zero-mass fields of consciousness preserved by a-a paradimensional layer of infinite energy? Morty, there's kind of a heaven! Kind of! I-I mean there definitely is for a neurotypical like your father. His conscious connection to a localized cultural model of infinity functions like a wick, sucking his little mind straight towards a source of energy strong enough to support collective projection. Great, so there's a heaven. Glad you could learn that by m*rder me eight times. He's got kind of a point, Rick. If you want to get into heaven, can't you just stop being an assh*le? First of all, I don't want to "get into" anywhere. I want to tap this paradimension's energy. Secondly, you wouldn't catch me dead in Jerry's generic-ass 1980s concrete and fog machine heaven. Well, guess what? You aren't welcome there! You raise a good point, Jerry, obviously by accident. My intact consciousness is too atheistic to get channelled to any afterlife worth robbing. It's a paradox. Unless... Morty, pack your parka. We're going to Norway.

You don't even know how to appreciate that because you've never been in energy debt. f*ck you. I've been tired. Perfect! - _ I'm going to Valhalla, Morty! Your grandpa's going to be the first Valhallanaut! Feel the excitement! Getting back will be easy. Once the machine turns on, I'll have set up the other side of the relay.
FEMALE VOICE: Phoenix Protocol initiated. Just hit that big red button to pull me into this body. But how are you getting there? I-I refuse to k*ll you again. I-I'm desensitized, Rick. I took some kind of test in school, a-and the counsellor had to call Homeland Security. Not your problem, Morty. I need to die in glorious battle against a mighty enemy. That's why I got Bigfoot in this Poké Ball. Bigfoot is your enemy? Well, I doubt he's a fan. I stuffed him into a ball. I mess with him all the time. These Vikings don't have real tight bylaws, Morty. This is basically their equivalent of Native American burial grounds. Bigfoot's dumb enough to att*ck whatever's in front of him. And all I gotta do is die. What happens to Bigfoot... after? Morty, Bigfoot is a "B" story. The "A" story is he kills me and you hit the button. Got it? - Got it.

Yes, now you'll receive your Armour. Knock, knock. Oh, wow. You're a new arrival. What do you require? Honestly, I-I'd love to take most of your tools. I'd planned on starting from scratch, but you're, like, way past the Iron Age here, saves me a lot of time. I make only the finest for Valhalla. Beautiful hammer. So, in Valhalla, what happens when we get knocked out? Then we're just knocked out. - Cool. Oh, wow, is that a thing Vikings love?

Surrender, witch! Easy, guys. Th-This was all a test, and you passed. I'm actually Odin. - Odin? Yep, Thor's father, Spider-Man's uncle, et cetera. I came here to do like an "Undercover Boss" thing, making sure Valhalla's running smooth, which it is, and as your reward, I'm assembling this majestic transdimensional energy relay, which none of you should ever touch, or it'll make your... goats... have haemorrhoids, understood? And you need nothing from us? I'm only here for a few hours, but since you're asking, I'd k*ll for a beer and a sandwich. Beef, cheese, no onions... Is someone writing this down? - Ow, my balls, ow, my balls, ow, my balls! - Morty? Why are you here? You are friends with the witch!
[SIGHS] What the f*ck, Morty! You're my ride home! Bigfoot k*lled me! He k*lled you, he k*lled me, and he was going to k*ll your clone. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, Morty, no! I-I opened the cage. Bigfoot was burying your body. He... He was mourning you! - He does that. Morty, any big idiot can pretend to believe in the afterlife. That's why we're dealing with these f*cking guys. They're just Norwegian Bigfoots. Jesus Christ, run this cable over there. We don't have much time.
