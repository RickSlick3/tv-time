Why are we waiting in line for food? It's a pop-up. It's a rare, pop-up restaurant thing that only enters our solar system... Rick.
MORTY: You're gonna spoil your appetite. That's a weird way to say I'm gonna stop being hungry by eating food, but whatever. Three crispy, uh, four wiggling. You're probably not even hungry. You just don't like lines because they aren't about you. Another weirdly aggressive way to describe a friend respecting themselves. Eugh!
HELIOS: What a wonderful thing to say! Ha ha! I was merely inspired by the wonderful thing you said! Sirs? Guys? You dropped this. Please, take it as a reward. So courteous! How nice it will be for you to eat what you were willing to stand in line for so much sooner. Oh, no, that's okay. I came to stand in line and then eat. I-I wouldn't wanna do it differently.
BOTH: Hmm... Dear fellow, I choose this moment to surrender my sword so that you may succeed me as the newest Knight of the Sun. What? No. I-I-I didn't even want your sandwich. I don't want your sword. Oh, believe me, son. You want it. I don't understand. You're knights? With a "K"? Of the Sun with a "U" or... or an "O"? Your alphabet is of no concern here. We are sworn defenders of Helios, the center of this system. Okay, so it's "Sun" with a "U."
RICK: Oh, God. Morty, don't take the sword. Oh, I'm shocked you're against something, Rick. You know these guys? I know how they're dressed and how boring this sounds. You take that sword, you're gonna get sucked into a whole complicated... Oh, sh*t! Come on, take it. Uh... I mean, if that kid's not gonna take the sword... He didn't offer it to you. Sorry. Can I just ask some stuff? W-What does a Knight of the Sun do? He takes the sword, for one thing. You know what? Maybe you made a bad call. He... He doesn't want the sword. I didn't say that. Well, you sure aren't taking it. Would you just take a random... Obviously I would, yes! And I did! Best decision of my life! And you're sh1tting on it! Excuse me? Is this just a free sword?
KNIGHTS: No! I'm taking the sword. Thank you, Dawnling. What is your name? Morty. Now it is Sir Mortaniel. I made it a little knightier. Good day. Wait, did he just... God damn it, Morty!

Yes. Thank you. Sir Helios gave his life with that sword. Mortaniel took it. He cannot leave unless he bests me in combat. Hmm. Okay, uh, one sec. I'm guessing these guys are, like, pseudo-immortalish since they live on the Sun, so playing by their rules might be the fastest way out of this. J-Just best him in combat. What? Here. This sword uses A.I. to learn from an opponent's att*cks. So I have to get att*cked first? No, no, no, the sword has already seen "Blade." And loved it. You'll be fine.

Look, I'm a drunk, I'm a psychopath, I'm a m*rder, but... when you called me boring... I shouldn't have. ... I needed to hear it.

[LAUGHTER] These guys live on our sun? I've never heard of them. I don't see them doing a lot to earn interplanetary fame. I beg your pardon, wizard. The Knights of the Sun protect the solar Scepter... around which even this world turns.
BETH: You do mean that, like, symbolically, right? Oh, quite literally. The Scepter is the center of the solar system. All planets orbit it. We keep it on the Sun so that Jupiter and Saturn don't bump into each other.
[LAUGHTER] Omigod. They don't even know sixth grade science. That's it! _ Yeah, so there you have it. Traditions suck ass, and your most foundational beliefs are total bullshit. We're supposed to take your word for it? Anyone can draw circles on a board and spout numbers. Yes, this sounds like a fun theory, sire, but it would take more than this for us to give up... Okay, so how do you guys think it works again? Well, the Scepter... Oh, you mean this old thing?
TOGETHER: Gaaah! You want it? Here. Take it back home. It's a symbol. It's your culture. That's not the same as reality. Does this mean we cut off our penises for absolutely no reason? That's the bad news. The good news is, you're free. Ooh, that stings. f*ck this knights sh*t.

Their aggression will be kept in check by a host of interplanetary treaties and alliances. It's very complicated, but as long as The Knights of the Sun stand together, the solar system will always have complete political stability. Where are the Knights of the Sun, by the way? I'm done pooping. Hmm? Did the, uh, Knights of the Sun... disband? While I was pooping? Sunnnn-kward. _ How many planets in our solar system have these clowns?
