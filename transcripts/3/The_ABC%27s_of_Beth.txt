Cold Open[]
[Beth, Summer and Morty are all sitting on the couch watching the television]
TV: In local news, child murderer Joseph Eli Lipnip is scheduled to die tomorrow by lethal injection, his execution already drawing dozens more spectators than the death of TV news. Carla?
Carla: The man that once ate his own son...
Beth: Wow. He's really getting executed after all this time. You know the son that he ate was...
Summer: Your best friend Tommy. We know. Stop true-crime bragging.
Beth: I was traumatized, Summer. Okay, your generation wouldn't get that.
Summer: Bitch, my generation gets traumatized for breakfast.
Beth: It took years of therapy to even process the reality. I mean, when I was a kid I just told myself that tommy had gotten lost in the magical realm of Froopyland.
Summer: "Froopyland?"
Beth: My make-believe world. I know the name's stupid, but it was so real to me.
[Rick enters the scene]
Rick: Aren't you guys supposed to be at your father's for custody weekend?
Morty: We're not in a hurry. Dad sleeps until sundown. Can we talk a little bit more, about this Froopy...
[Rick takes out a bubble gun and shoots a bubble which traps Morty inside]
[Rick opens the sliding door, and Morty floats outside]
Summer: Not the bubble gun! There's no air...
[Rick traps Summer in a bubble as well, who also floats out through the sliding door]
Beth: I gotta say, I am warming up to the bubble gun.
Rick: You know, if you're so great at naming things, why don't you do it from now on
Beth: What?
Rick: Froopyland. Was it my best work? I don't know. Does it deserve to be shit on creatively? Yeah, that's right. I agree with your look of horrified realization. You can be very inconsiderate sometimes.
[Cut to scene in the garage with Rick searching through a cardboard box]
Rick: Here it is. You know, I collapsed a quantum tesseract to...
Beth: Dad, I don't care how you made it. I want to know if Tommy's still in there!
Rick: [Draws a rainbow door using chalk] Relax, Beth. [Opens door] If he is, we'll find him. He'll be the only sun-bleached skeleton with non-imaginary DNA.
[Beth and Rick enter the door into Froopyland]
[Intro plays]
Act One[]
[Enter Froopyland]
Beth: Tommy! Tommy! This is a nightmare. I can't believe you used to lock me up in this glorified chicken coop.
Rick: Chicken coop? [Camera zooms out to show environment] Those are procedurally generated clouds, Beth. That river is a rainbow. Literally. Come on, I-I-I put real elbow grease into this place.
Beth: Well, you're supposed to put elbow grease into your daughter!
Rick: Gross.
Beth: Do you think something ate him?
Rick: Nope. Froopyland creatures were designed to be harmless. He definitely just starved to death.
Beth: I could have been the one who starved to death in here. What if I'd gotten hurt?
Rick: God you're right. I'm a terrible dad. Well, nothing to live for. Goodbye cruel world! [Proceeds to intentionally fall off a cliff]
Beth: Dad!
[Rick bounces off the floor, unscathed]
Rick: Oh, how do you like that? What kind of merciless creature makes the ground bouncy? I'm gonna have to drown myself.
[Beth jumps off the cliff as well]
Beth: Unh!
Rick: [Dips head into a rainbow river, attempting to drown himself] Oh, no. Oh, the water's breathable? Who went and did that?
Beth: Oh, whatever.
Rick: [Emerges from the river] Yeah, whatever. A dad makes a toilet look like R2-D2, and it breaks the front page of Reddit, but I'm Charles Manson because I gave you your own world instead of an iPad. I think the words you're looking for are... Aah! [A giant grotesque bird sinks its claws into Rick's arm, bouncing him around] Holy fuck! Shit! This thing has claws!
Beth: Yeah, I get it. It's a childproof world.
Rick: No, no, seriously, this hurts really bad! This thing is sinking its razor-sharp claws in... [Bird flies away with Rick] Aah! Shit!
Beth: You've made your point, Dad.
[Bird shrieks]
Beth: Dad?
[Cut to Jerry's apartment where Beth and Morty, still in bubbles, fly into the wall when the bubbles pop, gasping for air]
Summer: Whose idea was this stupid custody weekend thing?
Morty: I-I think it's supposed to help prevent abandonment issues.
Summer: I want to be abandoned.
Morty: Yeah, I'm talking about Dad.
[Jerry opens the door]
Jerry: Bienvenue a la Chez Divorced Dad.
Summer: Wow, Dad. Your place looks way less like a crackhouse. [Jerry closes door]
Morty: It's actually clean, like a cocaine house. Dad, what's going on?
Jerry: I'm simply centered, activated...
[Summer knocks a mug of coffee over, Jerry stops it using his mind]
Morty: And telekinetic?
Jerry: Pretty cool, huh? Check it out. Who wants a smoothie?
[Jerry uses his telekinesis to create a smoothie out of fruit, but does not put the top on]
Jerry: [Smoothie turns on] Oh... Oh, no. Uh, oh, God. Summer... Summer, can you... [Jerry pushes summer with his telekinesis]
Summer: Aah!
Jerry: Sorry.
[The smoothie stops and floats, as a Kiara, a female blue alien enters the room]
Kiara: You have much to learn, my Uloo.
Jerry: Morty, Summer, this is Kiara. She's a Krootabulan warrior priestess from Krootabulon.
Morty: I-I know where Krootabulans are from, Dad. Uh, Chaimuntolo.
Kiara: Chaimuntolo, younglings.
Summer: Hymen...cholo.
Kiara: Your father's mind holds love for you. I am humbled to meet in physicality.
Summer: Dad, are you --
Jerry: In love with a badass sexy alien lady? Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer. You tell me.
Summer: I wasn't going to ask if you were in love since you barely know her.
Jerry: Summer. Kiara and I met on that interstellar dating service Rick was always suggesting when your mom and I were together. And things just kind of clicked.
Kiara: We must move! Our reservation is at 7:00.
[Kiara phase shifts out of the apartment with a whoosh]
Jerry: I hate to see her leave, but I love to watch her phase shift away. I'm sure you noticed what she has three of, but guess what she has two of.
[a moment of silence]
[back to Froopyland, the Bird screeches as it flies grasping a screaming Rick]
Rick [landing in the Bird's nest]: Oof! [The Bird's three equally grotesque chicks peck at Rick] All right, knock it off! Listen, I've been giving you a pass because I'm charmed that life finds a way, but -- [one of the chicks bites Rick's shoulder, causing blood to spurt out of it] Aah! All right, you know what? [he pulls out a ray gun, and shoots two of the chicks, the third chick bites his gun-holding arm off] Ouch! [Rick falls out of the nest] Oh! [he lands on the bouncy ground] Uhh! Ouch! [he pulls out a device to replace his bitten-off arm] God! [he jams the device onto his bloody arm stumps, it makes a sizzling sound] Aah!  Agh! [the device makes a clicking sound]
[Beth walks over to where Rick is, the device creates a robotic arm]
Beth: (sarcastic) Oh, yeah, this place is the safest. Best dad ever. Can't you just say, "I admit it, I screwed up"?
Rick (he stands up): Uh, What would be the point of that?
Beth: (chuckles) You can't do it, can you? You can't just fucking apologize.
Rick: Okay, okay, Beth, I'm sorry... You think you deserve an apology.
[The Bird screeches from a treetop]
Rick: Hey, don't look at me. You let your kid roll around on the floor of a target, it's gonna get stepped on.
[The Bird screeches and flies towards Rick and Beth. Rick's robotic arm whirs and zaps the Bird, causing it to explode. The arm then analyzing the DNA from one of the Bird's remains]
Rick: Huh. Well, here's the problem right here. We've got a bunch of Froopyland procedural carbons all gummed up and mixed in with real human DNA.
Beth: Are you saying Tommy survived here by having sex with Froopy creatures, creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring, and then consuming their proteins, sustaining himself with an endless cycle of cannibalistic incest?
Rick: It's just a working theory. Of course, if that's the case, I expect he'd be worshiped as a kind of god by a medieval-level society of his least-delicious children.
[an army of Froopy creatures point spears at Rick and Beth]
Froopy soldier: Halt! You are now prisoners of our exalted ruler, giver and taker of life, humper and consumer of mortality, dispenser of life --
Rick: Yes, if I could interrupt? We're way ahead of the reveal here.
Beth: Yeah, just take us to King Tommy.
[Cut to a Japanese restaurant where Jerry, Kiara, Summer and Morty are eating. Jerry uses telekinesis to move his chopsticks]
Morty: I thought warrior priestesses could only keave Krootabulon on a hunt.
Jerry: [eating sushi via telekinesis] Mmm. [to Kiara] Thank you, sweetie.
Morty: I hope it's not human season.
Kiara: I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix. I would never hunt a human. [Kiara and Jerry hold hands] Your father and I are soul-bonded.
Morty: Soul-bonded?
Summer: Um, does your planet have shorter days, because you guys are moving kind of fast, no?
[Kiara sniffs. A worker at the restaurant reveals himself to really be a Varrix, and then crashes onto some people's meals. Kiara whooshes away into action]
Jerry: Go get him, honey! [Kiara and the Varrix continue outside, visible from the window in front of Jerry, Summer and Morty's table] She's always hunting. [he chuckles] She probably knew a Varrix worked here, and that's why she said the Yelp reviews didn't matter.
Morty: Dad, do you understand how serious Krootabulon soul-bonding is?
Jerry: (sarcastic) Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know. It's got such a casual name. If you want to lecture anyone about commitment, start with your mom.
Summer: Oh, my God. Dad, is that what this about? Are you rushing into a new thing to get back at Mom?
Jerry: Every weekend, you two have told me to move on.
Summer: Move on, like, out of bed. Like, stop using paper towels for toilet paper, not move on into a sloppy rebound.
Morty: Dad, you need to slow down, rethink this soul bond.
Jerry: Why don't you just say what you really mean? You think it's cool that having sex with her gives me telekinesis and you recognize she's got a hot bod like Cheetara in "Thundercats," but you're grossed out by her avocado-shaped head and blue skin, and you think I want to put a bag and a wig on her head. [Morty and Summer stare at Jerry.] After all the time and energy I spent teaching you two about race... [in the background, Kiara kills the Varrix, who screams] ...you ended up racist.
[Kiara whooshes back to Jerry's table in the restaurant]
Kiara: Soon your world will be rid of Varrix. Tomorrow, we celebrate.
Jerry: We could take the kids to the water park.
Kiara: We celebrate with a hunt!
Jerry: Ooh. You kids want to hunt?
Summer and Morty: (simultaneously, looking bored) Yes.
